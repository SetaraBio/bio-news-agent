# Development

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js for the executable workflow contract tests (available on GitHub-hosted runners).
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Quick Start

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv sync --locked
cp .env.example .env
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python src/main.py
```

Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` if you want the default graph path to use OpenAI directly. Placeholder values such as `sk-...` or `your_api_key_here` are treated as missing.

The default API model is `gpt-6-luna`. Set `OPENAI_MODEL` to override it.

## API response contract

The API graph uses separate dedupe and enrichment responses:

- Dedupe must return every requested group exactly once and account for every requested item exactly once as a keep or duplicate within its own group. Distinct keeps require explicit singleton clusters with `duplicate_ids: []`, including discovery-only items. Off-topic filtering belongs to enrichment; dedupe may omit `off_topic_ids` or leave it empty.
- Enrichment must account for every requested item ID exactly once in `items` or `off_topic_ids`, with no overlap, repeats, or unknown IDs. An omitted `off_topic_ids` defaults to an empty list.
- The complete set of response dispositions is validated before applying response contents or promoting a requested keep. Omitted candidates are not silently seeded or retained. Valid singleton/promotion behavior and optional title/summary defaults remain unchanged. Duplicate counts include each discarded item once; distinct-source coverage remains a separate measure.

Invalid API responses go through the existing broad exception handler into local fallback, like other API failures. The API workflow remains manual-only. The fallback policy and broader fallback candidate grouping are unchanged; grouping proposes comparisons and does not authorize deletion.

Regular comparison groups (both candidate export and API dedupe) also consider article-URL basename clues against the other item's original headline and summary. Two distinct alphabetic tokens of at least six characters are required, excluding configured company-name tokens and generic news/date words. Only absolute HTTP(S) links contribute; the basename is percent-decoded and trailing slashes are allowed. Hostnames, parent directories, query parameters, and fragments are ignored. Missing/non-string links, absent hosts, and URL/port parsing errors supply no hint. This is clue extraction, not comprehensive URL validation. Connected groups can contain different events: for example, the September 8 dystrophy reports can now be compared together, while the separate Novartis Lp(a) report must remain a singleton in the editorial decisions. URL clues do not prove event identity or guarantee the editor/model will recognize duplicates. They do not change high-confidence headline matching or local fallback grouping. The API payload is unchanged; URL clues affect grouping, not the fields sent to the model.

Local resolution merges items only within an existing group when their nonempty original headlines match after Unicode case folding and whitespace normalization (`" ".join(title.split()).casefold()`). It uses `original_title` when that value is a usable string, otherwise a usable `title`; non-string and empty values never become duplicate keys. Numbers, punctuation, word order, and negation remain significant. Summaries and shortened display titles cannot override differing original headlines.

This deliberately accepts false negatives: fallback digests may retain more differently worded coverage of the same event. Short matching headlines can remain in separate candidate groups and are not merged across groups. Identical generic headlines are still a semantic limitation: matching text does not prove two reports describe the same event. Duplicate summary backfill, distinct-source coverage, item IDs, URL deduplication, discovery filtering, and finalizer limits retain their existing behavior.

These API responses do not use the candidate snapshot/agent-decision envelope. The agent-decision contract and live automation prompts are unchanged. A changed grouping changes candidate IDs and the snapshot binding: export fresh candidates and write decisions for that exact snapshot instead of reusing an older decisions file.

## Agent-Driven Mode

This path keeps feed collection and filtering in Python, then lets Codex or Claude Code write editorial decisions without needing `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**The canonical operational runbook is [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).**

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python src/main.py --check-issue --issue-status-file digest-issue-status.json
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python src/main.py --candidates-only
# agent reads digest-candidates.json and writes digest-decisions.json
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python src/main.py --apply-decisions digest-decisions.json
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python src/main.py --dispatch-publish
```

`--check-issue` writes `digest-issue-status.json` by default. `--candidates-only` writes `digest-candidates.json` and `digest-run-status.json` by default. Use `--candidates-file <path>`, `--status-file <path>`, and `--issue-status-file <path>` to override these artifacts.

At handler entry, `--check-issue` removes the configured issue-status file before checking GitHub. `--candidates-only` removes the configured run-status and candidate files before its lazy graph import. Missing files are allowed; any other removal failure stops the handler before producer work. Successful invalidation prevents an unexpected failure from retaining those old artifacts. Normal success and expected error paths still write fresh status, including retryable issue errors and Bio's healthy `no_fresh_items` outcome.

This guard starts only when the selected handler is entered. Failures during `uv` or Python startup, top-level imports, argument parsing, or logging setup can still leave old artifacts. File existence alone does not prove that the latest command completed. The guard also does not make subsequent JSON writes atomic.

If `digest-run-status.json` reports `reason: "no_fresh_items"`, stop without writing decisions or dispatching publish. Partial feed failures remain visible in `feed_errors`, but only an all-feed failure makes candidate export fail.

Local runs prefer authenticated `gh` for `--dispatch-publish`; GitHub Actions and CI-style environments prefer `DIGEST_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GH_TOKEN` with workflow-dispatch access. Direct `--publish-issue` is still available as a manual fallback.

### Publication safety

`--dispatch-publish` freezes one `America/New_York` date and sends it as the required `digest_date` workflow input alongside the title and compressed body. The receiver passes it unchanged as `DIGEST_DATE`. Actions publishing rejects missing, malformed, noncanonical, past or future dates before contacting GitHub, and checks the date again after issue lookup before starting a write. An observed Eastern date change stops publication; a UTC date change alone does not invalidate the payload. The guard cannot undo a request already accepted by GitHub.

The API-build workflow freezes `DIGEST_DATE` before preflight and build. Title generation and issue selection use that same date. Both publishing workflows share the repository-wide `digest-publish-${{ github.repository }}` concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: false` and `queue: max`. This serializes Actions publishers, retains up to 100 pending runs, and leaves the existing final issue lookup inside the lock. Same-day retries update the existing issue rather than create another. Queue order is not a promise of dispatch order. See [GitHub concurrency documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/control-workflow-concurrency).

Direct local `--publish-issue` without `DIGEST_DATE` remains a manual fallback using the date when the command starts; an explicitly supplied date is still validated. It does not participate in the Actions lock and must not run concurrently with Actions publishers. Standalone `--check-issue` still checks today's issue. The date binds dispatch/build to publication, not the age of an arbitrary local `news.md`; regenerate stale local output instead of redispatching it as new news.

For rollout, merge the producer, receiver and workflow lock together in each repo, then update the local checkout before the next agent run. Older callers missing `digest_date` fail closed against the new receiver. Already-running workflows using older code are not retroactively protected; let those finish or handle them explicitly before relying on the new gate. No schedule or fallback-policy change is part of this batch.


## Decision Schema

The candidate snapshot's `decision_guidance` explains how to reference candidates and choose categories. It is included in the snapshot hash; existing schema-v5 snapshots without guidance remain valid when their hashes match. All references in `keep_id`, `duplicate_ids`, `off_topic_ids`, and `top_stories` must use the candidate's `item_id` (for example `g1i1`), never its article `id` or `link`. Cluster categories come from the top-level `categories` list, not the item-level category such as `All`.

Agent decisions should use this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "kind": "bio-news-agent.decisions",
  "snapshot_id": "sha256:<copy exactly from digest-candidates.json>",
  "executive_summary": "2-3 sentence overview of today's biotech/pharma news.",
  "top_stories": ["g1i1"],
  "groups": []
}
```

The empty `groups` skeleton above is valid only for a candidate snapshot with no groups; it is invalid for every nonempty snapshot. Every candidate group must appear exactly once, and every candidate item must be dispositioned exactly once as a keep, duplicate, or off-topic item. For example, given `g1i1` as a kept singleton, `g2i1` and `g2i2` as duplicate coverage of one story, and `g3i1` as off-topic, the exhaustive decisions are:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "kind": "bio-news-agent.decisions",
  "snapshot_id": "sha256:<copy exactly from digest-candidates.json>",
  "executive_summary": "2-3 sentence overview of today's biotech/pharma news.",
  "top_stories": ["g1i1"],
  "groups": [
    {
      "group_id": "g1",
      "off_topic_ids": [],
      "clusters": [
        {
          "keep_id": "g1i1",
          "duplicate_ids": [],
          "category": "Clinical & Research",
          "short_title": "Pfizer posts oncology trial results",
          "summary_line": "Why this matters in one sentence.",
          "tier": "high"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "group_id": "g2",
      "off_topic_ids": [],
      "clusters": [
        {
          "keep_id": "g2i1",
          "duplicate_ids": ["g2i2"],
          "category": "Regulatory & FDA",
          "short_title": "FDA updates gene therapy guidance",
          "summary_line": "Why this matters in one sentence.",
          "tier": "normal"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "group_id": "g3",
      "off_topic_ids": ["g3i1"],
      "clusters": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Every cluster must contain a list-valued `duplicate_ids`; use `[]` for a kept singleton. A standalone `discovery_only` item is valid decision input and must still be represented as an explicit singleton keep, but it is removed later during rendering. Decisions are fully validated, including snapshot binding and exhaustive dispositions, before any keep is promoted. Failed validation invalidates and removes any prior generated `news.md`, then stops before rendering or dispatch.

Omitting `top_stories` or setting it to `[]` allows automatic selection. When present, it must be a list of unique strings naming requested `keep_id` values from the decisions. Unknown IDs, URLs, duplicate/off-topic IDs, repeated entries, and malformed values are rejected before promotion or rendering. A valid requested keep may subsequently be promoted to a renderable sibling through the existing alias mapping; reference the requested keep, not the future promoted duplicate. Normal downstream discovery-only removal and ranking limits are unchanged. These checks apply to agent decisions; API enrichment's top-story behavior and the local categorization fallback are unchanged.

Guidance reduces authoring ambiguity but does not guarantee agent compliance. Validation prevents invalid references from silently selecting a different lead; it does not repair decisions or permit dispatch after an apply failure.

Use a canonical category from the candidate snapshot and a `tier` of `high` or `normal`. Optional `short_title` values that are missing, null, non-string, or blank retain the original source title. Valid strings have whitespace normalized and are limited to 8 words. This applies to agent decisions and API enrichment.

The resolved `coverage_sources` list contains additional distinct sources, excluding the kept source. Source labels have leading, trailing, and repeated whitespace normalized and are compared case-insensitively; empty labels are ignored and the first normalized display spelling is preserved. Coverage counts used in rendering, ranking, and API enrichment represent distinct source/newsroom labels, not the number of URLs. Publisher aliases are not merged.

`keep_id` always refers to one item id from a candidate group. Use `off_topic_ids` for items that should not appear in the digest. `summary_line` and `executive_summary` are kept as decision metadata and are not rendered in the issue body. The published issue title appends the leading top story, e.g. `Biotech / Pharma Headlines - Jun 12: MHRA approves oral GLP-1 for weight loss`, while same-day deduplication matches on the `ai-digest` label and creation date rather than the title.

By default, `Company News` is capped to the top 3 ranked items to keep the daily digest quick to scan.

## Feed Configuration

The collector reads RSS feed URLs from [`feeds.json`](../feeds.json). The file contains a JSON object where each key is a feed URL and each value specifies the `category` and human-readable `source` name.

RSS and Atom relative links are resolved before URL normalization and deduplication.
The final response URL (after redirects) supplies the default base; an absolute or
relative `Content-Location` header overrides it, and nested `xml:base` attributes
are handled by feedparser. See [feedparser's resolution rules](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resolving-relative-links.html).

Collection captures one UTC timestamp before fetching any feeds. Dated items are
accepted from exactly 24 hours before that timestamp through exactly one hour after
it, inclusive. The one-hour allowance tolerates publisher clock skew; later dates
and missing dates are excluded. Fetch duration does not move either boundary.
Filtering dates does not turn a successfully fetched and parsed feed into a failure;
feed-health and empty-day policies are unchanged.

RSS fetches use `RSS_USER_AGENT` first. If a feed returns HTTP 403, the collector retries
that request with `RSS_FALLBACK_USER_AGENT` because some feed CDNs reject non-browser
user agents.

Optional fields:

- `type`: source-specific handling such as paper limits
- `source_role`: source authority for duplicate tie-breaks and ranking. Supported values: `primary`, `independent_reporting`, `commentary`, `community`.
- `feed_mode`: whether a feed is part of the main digest or supporting discovery only. Supported values: `core`, `discovery_only`.

```json
{
  "https://example.com/feed.xml": {
    "source": "Example Feed",
    "category": "All",
    "type": "news",
    "source_role": "independent_reporting",
    "feed_mode": "core"
  }
}
```

## CI

Push and pull request CI runs `pytest` and `mypy`. Scheduled agent runs generate locally and dispatch the final publish through GitHub Actions so the final issue author is `app/github-actions`. Publisher issue matching and generated title dates use `America/New_York`, so a delayed run does not shift the digest to the wrong calendar day.
